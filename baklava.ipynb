    "## What is Baklava?\n",
    "Were you thinking BakLLava? The multi-modal vision LLM? No, this is the middle eastern dessert. It's a sweet pastry made of layers of filo filled with chopped nuts and sweetened and held together with syrup or honey. It's delicious.\n",

    "## Let's begin!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0. Ingredients\n",
    "To make Baklava, you'll need the following ingredients:\n",
    "- 2 packages of filo dough (about 28 sheets total)\n",
    "- 3-4 sticks of unsalted butter. I guess there's finally use for unsalted butter.\n",
    "- 2 lbs of walnuts\n",
    "- 7 cups of sugar, don't worry, we won't be eating nearly all of that\n",
    "- Some pistachios to garnish at the end\n",
    "- Rose water & Orange blossom water\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A quick note on Philo dough:** Make sure to keep it frozen until you're ready to bake! It'll crack if you thaw it and refreeze it. Once you're ready to bake, take it out to let it thaw. Make sure it thaws fully before unrolling it or it'll crack.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A follow-up note:** Don't stress about any details. There's lots of layers so any mistake on a layer will get diluted by the final product. As with all things in life, if you're having fun, it'll still taste good and that's all that matters. 😍\n",
    "\n",
    "So get the dough thawin' and let's begin 🤙\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, here's a photo of orange blossom water and rose water. You can find it at any local arabic market.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"bakllava/1.jpeg\" width=\"30%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Now add 1 cup of sugar and mix it up. My mom won't sleep well if you don't mix this by hand so go roll them sleeves up. Once the sugar is mixed up evenly, add ~ an espresso cup of Rose water and an espresso cup of Orange blossom water. Mix it up again, and youll notice it now holds form a bit like a paste.\n",

    "\n",
    "Bring 5 cups of water, 6 cups of sugar, and the juice of a half lemon to a boil. Keep stirring it so the consistency is even, and be careful to not overcook it. It shouldn't get too dark, and the consistency should be less thick than honey. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can leave this to boil while checking on it frequently. You'll want it to have sufficiently cooled before drizzling on the baklava."

    "\n",
    "While this photo includes a brush, I just used my fingers. Be gentle so you don't rip the dough. Don't worry about covering the entire sheet, you have many sheets, so if some parts are dry, just make sure there's more butter in that spot on the next sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you finish the first roll, massage the filling to be a flat even layer. Then continue adding butter sheet-by-sheet with the second roll on top.\n",

    "\n",
    "If we wait until baking is finished and try to cut the flaky crust, it'll crumble into a huge mess, so we need to gently cut the pieces before baking. Don't cut all the way through, maybe just until the filling.\n",
